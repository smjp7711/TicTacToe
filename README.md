## Overview
The goal of this program is to provide a lightweight, interactive way to enjoy the timeless game of Tic-Tac-Toe directly in the console. The program checks player moves, updates the game board in real-time, and announces the winner (or a draw) once the game ends.

## Features
- **Playable Game Board**: Players interact with a 3x3 matrix to place their moves.
- **Win Checking**: The program determines the winner by analyzing rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Loop Integration**: Game flow is managed using loops for seamless play.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players take turns making moves until the game concludes.

## How It Works
- A 3x3 matrix represents the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Players are prompted to enter their moves by specifying the row and column.
- The game verifies the validity of each move and updates the board.
- After every move, the program checks for a winner or a draw using logical conditions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smjp7711/TicTacToe.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TicTacToe
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
4. Build and run the project.

## Usage
- Launch the application from the console.
- Players take turns entering their moves (e.g., row and column numbers).
- The game announces the winner or a draw at the end of the match.
- Restart the game to play again!

## Future Improvements
Here are a few ideas for expanding the project:
- **AI Opponent**: Implement an AI player with varying difficulty levels.
- **Scoreboard**: Add a feature to keep track of player scores across multiple games.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Upgrade from console-based gameplay to a GUI.
